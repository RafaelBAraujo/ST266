# ST266
This repository contains two softwares, with both it's source code and documents.
Each one is inside the folder of it's respective developer's name.

The purpose of this repository comes from the discipline which both it's owners are subscribed in.
The disciplin is "Software Engineering II" and is taught at Unicamp's Technology Faculty.
The task given by the discipline was that:
1. Given a pair of developers, each must ask one another for a software to be developed as if they were each other's client.
2. The content of the development (documentation and source code) should be uploaded to a repository on GitHub.
3. At the end of the semester it must be presentend to the discipline's professor.

What's being developed:

On Rafael's folder is being developed a calculator that can sum, subtract, divide, multiply, find the square and square root of a number. The client has asked not only for those functions, but also, and the most caracteristic aspect of the software, a theme: São Paulo's Footbal Club.

On Vitor's folder is being developed a calculator that can sum, subtract, divide and multiply, and not only numbers, but also RGB values. The result of the calculations can be given either in decimal, hexadecimal, or octadecimal base, not of course including the result of the sum or subtract of RGB values, which is only given by a box colored with the resultant color.
