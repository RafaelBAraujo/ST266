# ST266
This repository contains two softwares, with both it's source code and documents.
Each one is inside the folder of it's respective developer's name.

The purpose of this repository comes from the course which both it's owners are subscribed in.
The course, "Software Engineering II", and is taught at Unicamp's Technology Faculty.
The task given by the course was that:
1. Given a pair of developers, each must ask one another for a software to be developed as if they were each other's client.
2. The content of the development (documentation and source code) should be uploaded to a repository on GitHub.
3. At the end of the semester it must be presentend to the discipline's professor.

What's inside:

On Rafael's folder you'll find a calculator developed in C++ that can sum, subtract, divide, multiply, and find the square and square root of a number. The client has asked not only for those functions but also, and the most caracteristic aspect of the software, a theme: SÃ£o Paulo Futebol Clube.

On Vitor's folder you'll find a calculator developed in C# that can sum, subtract, divide and multiply, and not only numbers, but also RGB values. The result of the calculations can be given either in decimal, hexadecimal, or octadecimal base, including, of course, the result of the sum of the RGB values, which is given simply by a box colored with the resultant color.
